# DSCI 100: Introduction to Data Science

### Calendar entry: DSCI 100 (3) Introduction to Data Science
Use of Data Science tools to summarize, visualize, and analyze data. Sensible workflows and clear interpretations are emphasized.

Prerequisite: MATH 12Repository for development of UBC's Introduction to Data Science course

## Expanded Course Description
In recent years, virtually all areas of inquiry have seen an uptake in the use of Data Science tools. Skills in the areas of assembling, analyzing, and interpreting data are more critical than ever. This course is designed as a first experience in honing such skills. Students who have completed this course will be able to implement a Data Science workflow in the R programming language, by “scraping” (downloading) data from the internet, “wrangling” (managing) the data intelligently, and creating tables and/or figures that convey a justifiable story based on the data. They will be adept at using tools for finding patterns in data and making predictions about future data. There will be an emphasis on intelligent and reproducible workflow, and clear communications of findings. 

## Coure Software Platforms
Students will learn to perform their analysis using the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/). Analysis development and reports will be done using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) Server.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Scrape data off the world-wide-web.
- Wrangle data from their native format into a fit-for-purpose format.
- Create, and interpret, meaningful tables from wrangled data.
- Create, and interpret, impactful figures from wrangled data.
- Apply, and interpret the output of, a simple classifier.
- Make and evaluate predictions using a simple classifier.
- Apply, and interpret the output of, a simple clustering algorithm.
- Apply, and interpret the output of, a regression model.
- Make and evaluate predictions using a regression model.
- Distinguish between in-sample prediction, out-of-sample prediction, and cross-validation.
- Apply and interpret a bootstrap analysis in a regression context.
- Accomplish all of the above using workflows and communication strategies that are sensible,
clear, reproducible, and shareable.

## Schedule
| Week | Topic | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Data wrangling and visualization | This week will be centered around an accessible case study that involves a full Data Science life-cycle – from scraping data off the web to producing figures and/or tables that tell a story. Students will be introduced to R and learn how to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). |
| 2 | Data wrangling and visualization, continued | This week will be centered around a slightly more challenging case study that again involves a full Data Science life-cycle. |
| 3 | Data wrangling and visualization, continued |This week will be centered around a slightly more challenging case study that again involves a full Data Science life-cycle. |
| 4 | Data wrangling and visualization, continued | This week will reflect on what we have learned from the three case-studies. What are generally good strategies for navigating along the Data Science life-cycle? There will be an explicit focus on workflow and reproducibility. |
| 5 | Transition week | Quiz #1, and head-start on Week 6 material. |
| 6 | Classification | The classification problem; applications to data; neighbourhood methods and majority vote. |
| 7 |Classification, continued | Metrics for classification accuracy; cross-validation to choose the number of neighbours; scaling of variables and other practical considerations. |
| 8 | Clustering | The clustering problem; applications to data; metrics for assessing clusters (between- versus within- cluster variation); K-means algorithm; choice of K and other practical considerations. |
| 9 | Transition week | Quiz 2, then remaining lecture and tutorial time focused on project/report/poster preparation.| 
| 10 | Regression | This week will introduce the problem of finding and estimating/approximating the relationship between a response variable of interest and a group of potential explanatory variables. The focus will be on prediction, relying on graphical tools to help the students "discover" simple non-parametric regression estimators (e.g. nearest neighbours, maybe kernel regression and/or regression trees). The prediction properties of these estimators will be explored using cross-validation. |
| 11 | Regression, continued | This week will focus on the distinction between goodness of fit and prediction properties (namely MSE vs MSPE). Again, based on an example (but this time higher-dimensional) we will compare the predictions obtained from highly adaptive but variable/unstable methods (e.g. nearest neighbours, large regression trees) with those from more restricted but stable ones (e.g. linear models). The interpretative advantage of linear models will be discussed as well. |
| 12 | Bootstrap applied to regression | This week will introduce the bootstrap, first by visualizing bootstrap samples and their fitted regression lines for a bivariate dataset. An intuitive case will be made for what the ensemble of slopes represents, Then we work through examples from multiple regression, emphasizing the scientific interpretation and relevance of the mix of negative/positive slopes. We will emphasize that this is a jumping off point for the study of statistical inference. |
